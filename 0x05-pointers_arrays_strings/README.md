* **1-swap.c** - swaps the value of two integers
* **2-strlen.c** - returns the length of a string
* **3-puts.c** - prints a string, followed by a new line to `stdout`
* **4-print_rev.c** - prints a string in reverse followed by a new line
* **5-rev_string.c** - reverse a string
* **6-puts2.c** - prints evry other character of a string starting with the first character
* **9-strcpy.c** - copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte (`\0`), to the buffe pointed to be `dest`
